what is modern data warehousing
- ai enhanced central repo that integrates various data types from multiple sources
- the data make uses of AI for intelligent processing
- AI like llm, slm and genai

why we need it
- real time to near real time decision making
- scalable and cost-effective 
- ai enhanced business intelligence and insights
- multi-cloud, hybrid and ai driven strategies

why data warehousing projects failed
- lack clear objectrives and requirement
- poor planning and management
- inadquate resources
- data quality issues
- technical challenges
- user resistance and lack of stakeholder
- insufficient user training and support
- scope creep

data warehousing helping BI
- ai powered centralized data repo
- ai driven historical data storage and predictive analysis
- ai driven data quality and consistency
- ai powered advanced analytics
- ai enhanced descriptive and diagnostic analysis
- ai-driven decision intelligence
- ai driven operational efficiency
- ai enhanced data security and compliance
- ai driven user accessibility and productivity

data warehouse vs database
- olap, ai driven predictive analysis; natural language query, slm for optimized performance, genai for automate report generation
- transactional operations, support oltp (real time)

# how about their data types when use ai

data base
- real time transaction data storing for operation
- lls for query generation faster info retrieve
- slm better database performance

warehouse
- historical and ai-augmented data storage for model training
- ai optimized schemas adjust query patterns based on workload
- ai driven classification -> structured categorization for efficient analytics

# how about volume and scalability
databaes
- high frequency transactional data
- slm for faster execution speed and less computational load

warehouse
- petabyte scale procesing, llm for inteligent query optimization
- slm for auto scaling efficiently
- gen ai for synthetic data generation
- multi-cloud and hybrid data warehouse strategies
