what is modern data mining
- analysis of massive datasets through advanced AI techniques

data minng vs database processing
- find hidden patterns, correlations and knowledge from large datasets
- CRUD data efficiently

also different in terms of approaches
- algorithms supervised/ unsupervised, preprocessing needed
- indexing, normalization, CRUD, maintain consistency and integrity

tools
- Python, mining software ...
- DBMS, and many databases ...

challenges
- high dimension and scalability, overfitting problems
- security, integrity and database availability

the challenges of data mining
- scalability with big data
- high dimensionality
- data governance and ethics
- bias in ai model

ethical challenges
- bias
- data privacy and security
- transparency
- misinformation or hallucination
- IP and copyright
- privacy and data security
- environmental sustainability
- accountability and responsibility

data mining in the future
- dominance usage of llm
- more gen ai usage
- rise of slm
- enhanced model interpretability
- cloud edge deployment
- ethical and responsible ai
- multimodal
