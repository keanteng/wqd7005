# WQD 7005 Lab Files

This repository contains coding files use for the course WQD 7005.
The file is used alongside my coursework for the purpose of practice and learning. Most of the files used in the course have been reworked to fit the current progress in the field of Generative AI. As more and more advanced models are being released, with small language model achieving state-of-the-art results, API access have been accessed to complete the lab tasks.

Happy coding âš¡
